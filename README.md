#What Do Sorting Algorithms Sound Like?

A little project for Hacker School, Fall 2012: Listen as famous sorting algorithms sort the musical scales. First you'll choose a sorting algorithm (right now you can choose insertion sort or bubble sort; more choices are on the way). You'll first hear a jumbled arrangement of the familiar musical tones. The sorting algorithms do their work by looping through the arrangement of tones and doing some logic that leaves them a little more sorted after each pass, until they are completely sorted (Do-Re-Mi...).
